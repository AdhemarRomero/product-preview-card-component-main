## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I reinforced that knowledge acquired in a self-taught way.

### Continued development

Just as I've learned things, I know I don't have clean code yet. So I will keep practicing to improve.

Any comments on this or other projects would be very helpful.
